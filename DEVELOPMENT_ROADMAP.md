## How to Use These Templates

1. **Create GitHub Issues**: Use each template to create individual GitHub issues in the repository
2. **Label Management**: Use the suggested labels to organize and filter issues
3. **Milestone Creation**: Create milestones for each phase of development
4. **Assignment**: Assign issues to team members based on their expertise
5. **Dependencies**: Follow the dependency chain when planning development work

## Priority Guidelines

### High Priority Issues
Must be completed for MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
- Backend Infrastructure (#1)
- Authentication & Authorization (#2)
- Employee Management (#3)
- Financial Management (#4)
- Payroll Management (#5)
