## Creating Issues in Order

Follow this order for optimal development flow:

1. **Foundation First**: Issues #1-2 (Backend Infrastructure, Authentication)
2. **Core Features**: Issues #3-5 (Employee, Financial, Payroll Management)
3. **UI Implementation**: Issue #9 (Frontend UI)
4. **Additional Features**: Issues #6-8 (Messaging, Dashboard, Operations)
5. **Quality & Deployment**: Issues #10-12 (Testing, Documentation, DevOps)

## Customizing Templates

Each template can be customized based on specific needs:
- Add/remove requirements
- Adjust effort estimates
- Modify acceptance criteria
- Update dependencies
- Add specific technical constraints

## Milestone Suggestions

Create these milestones to track progress:
- `Phase 1: Foundation` (Issues #1-2)
- `Phase 2: Core Features` (Issues #3-5, #9)
- `Phase 3: Communication & Analytics` (Issues #6-7)
- `Phase 4: Operations & Quality` (Issues #8, #10)
- `Phase 5: Production Ready` (Issues #11-12)

## Assignment Guidelines

Assign issues based on expertise:
- **Backend Developer**: Issues #1-8, #10, #12
- **Frontend Developer**: Issues #9, #10
- **DevOps Engineer**: Issues #1, #12
- **QA Engineer**: Issue #10
- **Technical Writer**: Issue #11
- **Product Manager**: All issues (for coordination)

## Managing Dependencies

Pay attention to issue dependencies listed in each template:
- Complete prerequisite issues before starting dependent ones
- Some issues can be worked on in parallel
- Frontend work depends on backend API completion
- Testing requires feature completion

## Tracking Progress

Use GitHub Projects to track progress:
1. Create a project board
2. Add all issues to the board
3. Use columns like: Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done
4. Move issues through the workflow
5. Use automation rules for status updates

## Getting Started

To begin development:
1. Create all 12 issues using the templates
2. Set up milestones and project board
3. Assign initial issues to team members
4. Start with Issue #1 (Backend Infrastructure)
5. Begin parallel work on Issue #9 (Frontend UI setup) once backend basics are in place

Remember: This is a large project requiring careful coordination and phased development!
