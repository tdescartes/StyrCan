## Description
Implement a comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and quality assurance processes to ensure the StyrCan platform is reliable, secure, and maintainable.

## Backend Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all API endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Service layer testing
- [ ] Authentication and authorization testing
- [ ] Security testing (OWASP compliance)
- [ ] Performance testing and benchmarking
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent users
- [ ] API contract testing

## Frontend Testing Requirements
- [ ] Component unit tests (React Testing Library)
- [ ] Integration tests for user workflows
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] Accessibility testing (axe-core)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Mobile responsive testing
- [ ] Performance testing (Lighthouse)
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Critical user journey testing
- [ ] Authentication flow testing
- [ ] Employee management workflow testing
- [ ] Payroll processing workflow testing
- [ ] Financial transaction testing
- [ ] Messaging system testing
- [ ] Dashboard functionality testing
- [ ] Error handling and edge case testing

## Testing Tools & Frameworks
### Backend Testing
- **Python**: pytest, pytest-asyncio
- **API Testing**: FastAPI TestClient
- **Database Testing**: pytest-postgresql
- **Mocking**: unittest.mock, pytest-mock
- **Load Testing**: Locust or Artillery

### Frontend Testing  
- **Unit Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright or Cypress
- **Visual Testing**: Percy or Chromatic
- **Accessibility**: @axe-core/react
- **Performance**: Lighthouse CI

## Test Coverage Requirements
- [ ] Backend code coverage > 80%
- [ ] Frontend component coverage > 75%
- [ ] Critical path coverage > 95%
- [ ] API endpoint coverage 100%
- [ ] Authentication flow coverage 100%

## Quality Assurance Processes
### Code Quality
- [ ] ESLint configuration for frontend
- [ ] Black/flake8 configuration for backend
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks setup
- [ ] Code review guidelines
- [ ] Static code analysis

### Continuous Integration
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow setup
- [ ] Automated testing on PR creation
- [ ] Build verification testing
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability checking

### Bug Tracking & Reporting
- [ ] Bug report templates
- [ ] Severity classification system
- [ ] Bug reproduction guidelines
- [ ] Resolution tracking process

## Security Testing
- [ ] Authentication bypass testing
- [ ] SQL injection testing
- [ ] XSS vulnerability testing
- [ ] CSRF protection testing
- [ ] Data validation testing
- [ ] Authorization testing
- [ ] Session management testing
- [ ] API security testing

## Performance Testing
### Backend Performance

- [ ] Test data management system
- [ ] Database seeding for tests
- [ ] Mock external service dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All critical user flows have automated tests
- [ ] Test coverage meets minimum requirements
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests automatically
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are established and monitored
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility is verified
- [ ] Accessibility standards are tested and met
- [ ] Bug tracking process is documented and followed

## Test Documentation
- [ ] Testing strategy documentation
- [ ] Test case documentation
- [ ] Manual testing procedures
- [ ] Performance benchmarking results
- [ ] Security testing reports

## Dependencies
