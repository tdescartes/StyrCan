## Database Schema
```sql
- conversations table
- messages table
- participants table
- message_attachments table
- announcements table

- `POST /api/conversations` - Create new conversation
- `GET/POST /api/conversations/{id}/messages` - Message operations
- `POST /api/announcements` - Create announcement
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get notifications

## WebSocket Events
- `message.send` - Send new message
- `message.receive` - Receive message
- `typing.start/stop` - Typing indicators
- `announcement.broadcast` - New announcement

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can send and receive messages in real-time
- [ ] Broadcast announcements reach all intended recipients
- [ ] Message history is properly stored and searchable
- [ ] File sharing works securely
- [ ] Notifications are delivered reliably
- [ ] UI is responsive and user-friendly
- [ ] System handles high message volume
- [ ] Privacy and security are maintained
