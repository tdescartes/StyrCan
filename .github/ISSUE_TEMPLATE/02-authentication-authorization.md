## Description
Implement a secure authentication and authorization system to manage business owners, administrators, and employees with appropriate role-based access control.

## Requirements
- [ ] User registration and login system
- [ ] Role-based access control (Business Owner, Admin, Employee)
- [ ] JWT token-based authentication
- [ ] Password hashing and security
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Account verification system

## Technical Details
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh token mechanism
- **Authorization**: Role-based permissions (RBAC)
- **Password Security**: bcrypt or similar hashing
- **Database**: User tables with proper relationships
- **Security**: Rate limiting, brute force protection

## User Roles
1. **Business Owner**: Full system access, user management
2. **Administrator**: Employee management, payroll, reports
3. **Employee**: Limited access to personal data, messaging

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register and login securely
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
- [ ] Role-based permissions are enforced on all endpoints
- [ ] Password reset flow works via email
- [ ] User profiles can be created and updated
- [ ] Session management handles token expiration
- [ ] Security measures prevent common attacks

## Dependencies
- Backend Infrastructure Setup (#1)

## Estimated Effort
High (6-10 days)
